you're a goblin in a velocity based platformer. theres currently 5 levels.

use sliding, jumping, launchpads and coins to gain speed!


made in godot, so thats pretty neat :>

and as with all my other games, i make all the assets and code myself !

## Controls!!

â€‹use WASD to move, and SHIFT to slide!
